Clipboard Enhanced (clen) is a script for AutoHotkey tool.
AutoHotkey can be downloaded from http://www.autohotkey.com

Main  feature  of  clen  is providing multiple exchange clipboards in a different ways.
First  of  all clen provides ten static clipboards. One can copy into one of the static
keyboards by pressing Left Window key + one of the numeric keys (from 1 to 0). To paste
from  one of the static clipboards combination of Right Window key + one of the numeric
keys  should be used. Pressing just Right Window key will cause AutoHotkey to display a
tray tip message with content of all static clipboards.
 
Also clen provides dynamic clipboard. Dynamic clipboard can be used as a queue or stack
of  values. By default pressing of Left Window key + Insert cause selected object to be
added  to the beginning of the queue. Pressing Right Window key + Insert will cause one
value  (if  any  exist)  to  be  pasted from the beginning of the queue. Pressing Right
Window key + Delete will cause one value to be passed from the end of the queue.

Pressing  just Left Window key will cause AutoHotkey to display a tray tip message with
content of dynamic clipboard queue.

One  should  note  that  unlike  static clipboards values from dynamic clipboard will be
removed  from  the  queue automatically after pasting. If dynamic clipboard contain many
values  pressing  of Right Window key + Insert in series will cause pasting those values
from dynamic clipboard one by one.

Of course clen is a subject of change. All your proposals are welcome.
