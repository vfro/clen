===Regular Clipboard===

Clen tracks history for a regular Windows clipboard. Length of history is unlimited. You may browse by it by pressing *Ctrl+Numpad Sub* / *Ctrl+ Numpad Add* hotkeys or selecting "Regular Clipboard\Previous Value" or "Regular Clipboard\Next Value" from tray menu.

===Static Clipboards ===

Clen provides nine static clipboards. You may copy some value to any of it and then paste it back at any time. The hotkeys for using of Static Clipboards is the following:
 * Press *Ctrl + Numpad Number (form 1 to 9)* to copy a value into one of the static clipboard.
 * Press *Shift + Numpad Number (form 1 to 9)* to paste a value from one of the static clipboard into environment.

===Dynamic Clipboards===

In addition to static clipboards clen provides dynamic clipboard which can contain multiple values and manage them as a queue or a stack. The hotkeys for using of Static Clipboards is the following:

 * Press *Ctrl + Numpad Insert* to copy and push new value into the top of the queue.
 * Press *Shift + Numpad Insert* to remove and paste a value from the bottom of the queue.
 * Press * Shift + Numpad Delete* to remove and paste a value from the top of the queue.

===Password Clipboard===

Password clipboard shows asterisks instead of real value in notification balloon, don't track any history, and clears automatically right after pasting.

Some password managers insert password values into a regular clipboard. Password clipboard had an option to wait for a password and intercept it. Value will be copied into password clipboard instead of a regular one.

 * Press *Ctrl + Numpad Mult* to copy a value into the password clipboard.
 * Press *Shift + Numpad Mult* to paste a value and clear the password clipboard.
 * Press * Ctrl + Shift + Numpad Mult* to activate wait for a password mode.

===Options===

 * ====Stack-based dynamic clipboard model====
By default dynamic clipboard works as FIFO (first in first out). Turn on this option and dynamic clipboard will work as FILO (first in last out).

 * ====Duplicate values to regular clipboard====
When this option is turned on regular clipboard will contain a value each time when it is copied into static or dynamic clipboard. By default this option is turned off.

 * ====Automatically show content====
Show notifications in a tray balloon each time when one of clipboards is changed. It is turned on by default.

 * ====Copy\Paste via Ctrl+Insert\Shift+Insert====
Some programs don't work with Ctrl+Insert\Shift+Insert hotkeys as Copy\Paste commands, but some of them don't work with Ctrl+C\Ctrl+V. This option allow you to customize what hotkey clen will use for coping to and pasting from all clipboard types. By default clen will use Ctrl+Insert\Shift+Insert.

 * ====Run when Windows starts====
Clen will run at Windows startup. By default this option is turned on.
